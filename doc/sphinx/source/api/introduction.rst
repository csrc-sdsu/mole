Introduction
============

Welcome to the introduction to MOLE (Mimetic Operators Library Enhanced). 

This section provides a high-level overview of the library's goals, purpose, and major features. The MOLE library aims to deliver robust, efficient, and maintainable numerical operators for mimetic difference methods.

Key Features
-------------

- **Mimetic Operators**: Support for divergence, gradient, curl, and other core operators.

- **Boundary Conditions**: Easily set Dirichlet, Neumann, and Robin boundary conditions.

- **High-Performance Computation**: Uses efficient linear algebra libraries like Armadillo.

- **Cross-Language Support**: API available for both **C++** and **MATLAB**.

- **Documentation & Examples**: Includes tutorials, usage examples, and implementation guides.
