# 1D Transport Equation

This example uses MOLE to solve the 1D advection-reaction-dispersion
equation. The equations is given by:

$\frac{\partial C}{\partial t} + v \, \frac{\partial C}{\partial x} = D \, \frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial x^2}$

where $C$ is the concentration, $v$ is the pore-water flow velocity, and
$D$ is the dispersion coefficient.
