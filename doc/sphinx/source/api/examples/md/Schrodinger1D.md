# 1D Schr√∂dinger Equation

This example solves the 1D time-independent Schrodinger equation:
$$H \, \psi = E \, \psi$$

where $H$ is the Hamiltonian operator, $\psi$ is the wave function, and
$E$ is the energy. The Hamiltonian includes the kinetic energy term
represented by the Laplacian and a potential energy term.
