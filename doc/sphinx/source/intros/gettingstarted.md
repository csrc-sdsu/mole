# Getting Started

Welcome to the getting started guide for MOLE (Mimetic Operators Library Enhanced). This guide will help you set up and run your first MOLE project.

```{include} ../../../../README.md

:end-before: "## Documentation"
:name: installation-and-examples+test-section-include
```

## Quick Start Examples

Here are some simple examples to help you get started with MOLE:

### C++ Example

```{literalinclude} ../../../../examples/cpp/transport1D.cpp
:language: cpp
:linenos:
:caption: transport1D example (examples/cpp/transport1D.cpp)
```

### MATLAB/Octave Example

```{literalinclude} ../../../../examples/matlab/elliptic1D.m
:language: matlab
:linenos:
:caption: elliptic 1D example (examples/matlab/elliptic1D.m)
```

## Next Steps
