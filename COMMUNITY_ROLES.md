# MOLE Open-Source Ecosystem Community Roles

The MOLE Open-Source Ecosystem (OSE) organization places great value in its community, and community engagement is one of the pillars of the organization. The **_MOLE OSE Community_** comprises all MOLE stakeholders from the MOLE leadership team to all individuals interested in the MOLE functionalities and applications that use the MOLE library. Here, we define the different roles that members in the MOLE community play.

## MOLE Leadership Team

This group is composed of the library development founders, current lead developers, and software maintainers and managers of the MOLE OSE. The leadership team is responsible for maintaining the cohesiveness, robustness, security, reliability, succession plans, integrity, and quality of the software library.

The current members of the MOLE Leadership team are:

- Prof. Jose Castillo (founder),
- Dr. Johnny Delgado Corbino (founder),
- Prof. Valeria Barra,
- Dr. Jared Brzenski,
- Dr. Tony Drummond,
- Prof. Miguel Dumett,
- Dr. Giulia Pagallo,
- Prof. Chris Paolini,

In addition to the MOLE Leadership Team, the MOLE OSE organization counts with a **MOLE Steering Council** to facilitate the decision-making processes based on community consensus. The council members are formed by the leadership team members, chairs from the MOLE governing circles, MOLE founders, and strategic partners who financially support the MOLE OSE. For more details consult the [MOLE OSE Organization page](OSE_ORGANIZATION.md).

## MOLE OSE Contributors

A contributor is anyone who has made contributions to the MOLE Library or the MOLE Open-Source Ecosystem.  A full list of contributors is available in the [Our Contributors Section](https://mole-docs.readthedocs.io/en/main/intros/contributing_wrapper.html) in the [MOLE repository](https://github.com/csrc-sdsu/mole). In addition to technical and conceptual contributions to the open-source software, the MOLE community includes contributions from industry, academic and professional connections that can also support the community through financial or managerial resources. Contributors help sustain the MOLE ecosystem and are invited to participate in the evaluation of the MOLE organizational pillars.

## MOLE OSE Collaborators

Collaborators are a multidisciplinary group of members from industry and academia with whom the MOLE leadership team collaborates in the development of new computational applications using the MOLE library, or developers from other open-source ecosystems that interoperate with the MOLE library.  Collaborators are also MOLE Contributors, and together with the leadership team work on the sustainability of the MOLE open-source ecosystem.

The current list of collaborators include:

- [Chombo](https://commons.lbl.gov/spaces/chombo/pages/73468344/Chombo+-+Software+for+Adaptive+Solutions+of+Partial+Differential+Equations): Software for Adaptive Solutions of Partial Differential Equations
- [Overture](https://www.overtureframework.org/): An Object-Oriented Toolkit for Solving Partial Differential Equations in Complex Geometry
- Fortran API to the MOLE library, collaboration with Damian Rousson at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.

## MOLE Library Users

Users are all members from industry and academia who are using MOLE to implement PDE Solvers. Users are a vital part of the MOLE Community, and their feedback is collected by the [MOLE Leadership team](#mole-leadership-team), and used in strategic planning. MOLE Users are encouraged to become MOLE Contributors.

## MOLE OSE Curious

Anyone with an interest in **_Mimetic Discretization_** and the fast prototyping of numerical solutions using MOLE from Matlab, C++ or Python. Individuals interested in knowing more about MOLE should sign up for our mailing lists, check the [MOLE website](https://mole-docs.readthedocs.io/) and [GitHub repository](https://github.com/csrc-sdsu/mole), where anyone can check MOLE forums.
