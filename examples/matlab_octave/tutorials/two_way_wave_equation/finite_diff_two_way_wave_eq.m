%% FINITE_DIFF_TWO_WAY_WAVE_EQ
%  Solve the 1D two-way wave equation using standard finite differences.
%
%  PDE:      d^2u/dt^2 = c^2 * d^2u/dx^2    on domain [-2, 2]
%  Scheme:   Centered-in-Time, Centered-in-Space (CTCS)
%            Explicit second-order accurate in time and space
%
%  Time-stepping update:
%      U^{n+1} = 2*U^{n} - U^{n-1} + (c^2 * dt^2 * D_fd) * U^{n}
%  where D_fd is the standard second-derivative finite-difference matrix:
%
%      D_fd = (1/dx^2) * tridiag([1, -2, 1])
%
%  OUTPUTS:
%    U2_fd       - Final solution vector at last time step
%    error_fd    - Norm of error vs. analytic or reference solution
%    walltime_fd - Wall-clock time (seconds) for the simulation
%    flops_fd    - Estimated floating-point operation count
%
%  SEE ALSO:
%    mimetic_diff_two_way_wave_eq, comparison_two_way_wave_md_vs_fd
%
%  NOTES:
% We use a larger domain for graphing wave movement without bondary issues.
% This removes any boundary, so we can compare just the methods, without
% having to do anything for the boundary. A straightforward comparison of
% just the methods.
%
% The discretization has a second order accurate time scheme, so it will never
% get >2 convergence. This file is commented for first time users, to explain
% and show differences with the mimetic difference method.
