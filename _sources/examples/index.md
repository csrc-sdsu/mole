# Examples

The MOLE library contains many examples written in OCTAVE/MATLAB and C++. These examples span a broad range of partial differential equations (PDEs). Below are more technical explanations of the examples included in the library.

**NOTE**: The name for both OCTAVE/MATLAB and C++ will be the same. The files `elliptic1D.m` and `elliptic1D.cpp` solve the same differential equation explained here under Elliptic1D. There are many more OCTAVE/MATLAB examples, so if you cannot find a C++ example, it is only in the OCTAVE/MATLAB folder.
